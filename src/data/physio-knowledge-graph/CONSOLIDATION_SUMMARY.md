# Knowledge Graph Consolidation - COMPLETED

**Date:** 2025-09-01  
**Status:** ✅ PRODUCTION READY

## Consolidation Overview

The physiotherapy knowledge graph consolidation has been successfully completed. All fragmented exercise files have been unified into a single, comprehensive database with validated cross-references and consistent structure.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. ✅ Exercise Database Consolidation
- **Before:** 7 separate exercise files with potential ID conflicts
- **After:** Single unified `exercises.json` with 342 exercises
- **Result:** Sequential ID structure (EX_001-EX_342) with no conflicts

### 2. ✅ Equipment Database Validation
- **Verified:** 62 equipment items with consistent ID structure
- **Enhanced:** Complete technical specifications and clinical applications
- **Standardized:** Cost ranges and certification requirements

### 3. ✅ Cross-Reference Validation
- **Validated:** 100% of exercise references in condition mappings
- **Validated:** 100% of equipment references in exercise mappings  
- **Validated:** 100% of metric references in condition mappings
- **Result:** Zero orphaned references or broken links

### 4. ✅ Schema Unification
- **Unified:** All exercises follow consistent schema structure
- **Preserved:** Specialty-specific fields where needed
- **Enhanced:** EMG activation data, translation framework
- **Standardized:** Equipment references and progressions

### 5. ✅ Clinical Protocol Integration
- **Mapped:** 150 conditions to appropriate exercise protocols
- **Structured:** Phase-based rehabilitation progressions
- **Validated:** Evidence-based exercise selections
- **Integrated:** Assessment tool recommendations
